May 2010 Release

At this time there are no required applications that are specific to the model 428 multi-line wavelength meter.

A LabVIEW driver is available in the \LabVIEW_drivers folder.

Copies of the USB virtual com port driver and the driver installation application are in the \VCP_drivers folder.  These are automatically copied to the user's hard drive and the driver is installed if the CD autoplay function is activated.
